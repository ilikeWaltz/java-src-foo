// java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier
// A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. 
// CyclicBarriers are useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called cyclic because it can be re-used after the waiting threads are released. 

// cyclic: repeated many times and always happening in the same order.
// barrier: an object like a fence that prevents people from moving forward from one place to another.
